# Diamond-Dataset-Assessment
Includes Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Exploration of the dataset

## Project Overview
We are working with a dataset with prices and attributes of approximately 54,000 round-cut diamonds. 
The project includes explanatory data visualization, systematically starting from univariate visualizations, 
moving through bivariate visualizations, and finally multivariate visualizations. 

## Data columns:
price: Price in dollars. Data was collected in 2008.
carat: Diamond weight. 1 carat is equal to 0.2 grams.
cut: Quality of diamond cut, affects its shine. Grades go from (low) Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal (best).
color: Measure of diamond coloration. Increasing grades go from (some color) J, I, H, G, F, E, D (colorless).
clarity: Measure of diamond inclusions. Increasing grades go from (inclusions) I, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (internally flawless).
x, y, z: Diamond length, width, and depth, respectively, in mm.
table: Ratio of width of top face of diamond to its overall width, as a percentage.
depth: Proportional depth of diamond, as a percentage. This is computed as 2 * z / (x + y), or the ratio of the depth to the average of length and width.

For this project, we will concentrate only the variables in the top five bullet points: 
price and the four 'C's of diamond grade.
